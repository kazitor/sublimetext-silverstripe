# sublimetext-silverstripe

Work in progress. Currently a minimal syntax file that can highlight basic variables, comments and control structures.

## Installation

Press the green "Clone or download" button for how to get it; use "Download ZIP" if you're not using Git.

Open Sublime Text, go to Preferences->Browse Packages in the toolbar (`alt+n+b`), and place the folder there.

## Usage

It automatically associates itself with `.ss` files, but you can also set it manually with `ctrl+shift+p` then `ssss+enter`.
